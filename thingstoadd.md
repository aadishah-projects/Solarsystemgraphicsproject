Here are some fundamental things you can add to your **Solar System Simulation** to improve and expand it:  

### **🌟 Enhancements & Features to Add**  

#### **1️⃣ Visual Improvements**  
- **Starry Background** ✨: Add randomly placed white dots to simulate stars.  
- **Planet Textures** 🪐: Use images instead of solid colors for realistic planets.  
- **Smooth Trails** 🌠: Use a fading effect for better visual appeal.  
- **Orbit Paths** 🌀: Improve dashed orbit lines to be more visually accurate.  

#### **2️⃣ Physics & Accuracy**  
- **Kepler’s Laws** ⚖️: Adjust orbital speed based on actual planetary mechanics.  
- **Elliptical Orbits** 🔄: Instead of perfect circles, simulate slightly elliptical orbits.  
- **Planetary Rotation** 🔁: Make planets rotate around their own axis.  

#### **3️⃣ Interactivity**  
- **Zoom & Pan** 🔍: Allow users to zoom in/out and move around the simulation.  
- **Speed Control** 🎮: Adjust the simulation speed dynamically.  
- **Planet Info Panel** ℹ️: Show details when hovering over a planet.  

#### **4️⃣ Additional Objects**  
- **Asteroids & Comets** ☄️: Add moving objects with irregular orbits.  
- **Moons** 🌙: Simulate moons orbiting planets.  
- **Spacecrafts & Satellites** 🚀: Introduce artificial satellites or probes.  

#### **5️⃣ UI & Sound**  
- **Background Music & SFX** 🎵: Add ambient space sounds or planet-specific effects.  
- **Better UI Elements** 🖥️: Buttons for toggling features like trails, labels, or paths.
